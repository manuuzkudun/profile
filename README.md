## Background & Objectives

Add simple CSS rules to design fonts and colors of your profile page.

## Specs

[This is an example](http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/02-fonts-colors/) of what you should reproduce. Here is a list of CSS rules to write:

### Body

Pick a nice `background-color`, `font-family` / `color` / `font-size` and `line-height` for the `<body>`. **Setting these font rules at the body-level will apply them on all basic texts** (`<p>`, `<li>`, etc...).

### Headers

- Choose a nice color and font-family for headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
- Choose harmonious `font-size` and `line-height` for headers
- Hint: **small headers** are much more subtle. Check any website (Medium, Airbnb, etc.), you'll see that the font-size of their headers is quite small.

### Links

- Change links' `color` & `text-decoration`
- Add some hover effects on links using the pseudo-class `a:hover`.

## Further suggestions & resources

- Use a color picker plugin to pick nice colors from other websites (Sip, Colorzilla, etc..). You can find inspiration on [Coolors](http://coolors.co/) or [Color hunt](http://colorhunt.co/).
- Pick your fonts on [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
- On Google fonts, **Open Sans** is the standard choice for core texts (`body`). **Raleway**, **Varela**, **Montserrat**, **Roboto** are elegant candidates for headers. We already made these choices for you (look at the `<head>` of your HTML page), but feel free to change it and be creative!
